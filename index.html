      5 Ways of Thinking Like a Programmer
    </h2>
      <ul class = "one">
        <li>Procedural Thinking - creating prefectly clear and unambiguous instructions for a computer to follow.</li>
        <li>Abstract Thinking - finding the similarity or generality amongst seemingly different things</li>
        <li>Systematic Debugging - relentlessly identifying the cause of a computer program to not to work.  When a program doesn't work, it's because there is a mistake/bug somewhere in the computer code.</li>
        <li>Technological Empathy - comes in many forms.  For example, computer empathy is the ability to understand what a computer is, how it works, and what its good and bad at doing.</li>
        <li>Systems Thinking - happens when you break a big problem down into smaller pieces.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>
      <h2>
        What components make up the the World Wide Web?
      </h2>
      <ul class = "two">
        <li><em>HTTP</em> - Protocol for the web</li>
        <li><em>Servers</em> - Computers that have the files that makeup the web</li>
        <li><em>Internet</em> - The world's largest computer network</li>
        <li><em>Browser</em> - A program that runs on your computer to display files found on the web</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The Internet uses HTTP to communicate with you, your browser, and servers.
      </p>
       <h2>
        Basic HTML Language
      </h2>
       <ul class = "three">
        <li><em>Tag</em> - an HTML tag is always contained with brackets.  Most have an opening and closing tag.  
        Void tags do not require a closing tag</li>
        <li><em>Element</em> - refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags</li>
        <li><em>Attibute</em> - This is a property of an HTML element.  
        For example:<a href= "www.udacity.com"> Udacity.com</a></li>

         <li>The web </li>
         <li> HTML </li>
         <li> URLs </li>
         <li> HTTP</li>

   Major pieces of the web: you, your computer, the Internet, and servers.

      <h3>
        The World Wide Web is a collection of HTML documents that include.
      </h3>
    <ul class = "five">
          <li> HTML</li>
          <li> Hyperlinks</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      HTML and CSS are both "languages".
      HTML,<em>Hypertext Markup Language, </em>controls the structure of the webpage and 
      CSS, <em> Cascading Style Sheets,</em> controls the style of the  page; how it works.
      When programmers talk about the "DOM" <em>Document Object Model</em> they are talking about the <b>tree-like</b> structure of a page.
    </p>
       <h3>
        HTML is made up of:
     </h3>
     <ul class = "six">
        <li> Text content ---what you see</li>
        <li> Markup --- what it looks like</li>
        <li> References to other documents</li>
        <li> Links to other pages</li>
     </ul>
    <p>
      HTML documents are made up of HTML elements. 
      HTML elements comprise of an opening tag, contents, and closing tag.
    </p>
      <h3>
        Computers are Stupid!!
      </h3>
    <p>
      Think about how sensitive computers are to typos and how small mistakes can lead to huge problems when given to the 'stupid' computer.
    </p>
      <h3>
        Inline vs Block Elements
      </h3>
    <p>
      Inline Elements end a line.  Block elements create an invisible box around the text that has 
      height and width features.

      LESSON 2: Creating a Structured Document with HTML
    </h2>
    <p>
      <em>HTML</em> files are like the structure of your house. <br>
      <em>CSS</em> files are like the style of your house.  For example, the color of your walls.<br>
      <em>Javascript</em> files are like your interactive functions.  For example, your remote control.
    </p>
    <p>
      Browsers create a tree-like structure of the web.

      <em> Repetition</em> should be avoided in your code.  It makes it difficult to read and to find mistakes.
